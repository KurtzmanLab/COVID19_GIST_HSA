**This is a free online repository for sharing GIST/HSA data of COVID19 related protein targets**

Currently, we have the GIST/HSA data for 7 targets:

Structures 1-5  (SARS-CoV-2 structures)
Main Protease (Mpro, 3CLpro): **_6LU7_** (2.16 Å), **_6YB7_** (1.25 Å), **_6M03_** (2.00 Å), **_6Y84_** (1.39 Å), **_6W63_** (2.10 Å). Target the substrate binding site of Mpro.

Structure 6  (SARS-CoV-1 structure)
Helicase (Nsp13): **_6JYT_** (2.80 Å). Target (1) the ADP binding site but discourage (2) the nucleic acids binding site. *No SARS-CoV-2 structure exists for this protein.

Structure 7  (SARS-CoV-2 structure)
Nsp16 (2’-O-methyltransferase, nsp 10/16): **_6W4H_** (1.80 Å). Target: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site.


We ran two MD simulations for each target, with the protein heavy atoms restrained( denoted as "rigid") or with the protein side chains left flexible (Donated as "SCflex". For targets 6W63 and 6YB7, we also provides the data that generated by Dr. Dan McKay( From Novartis)'s prepared structures and MD protocols. In Mckay's MD protocol, the protein are total left flexible except the alpha C of a few residues( For details, please refer to the amber parameters under the amber directory).

For an explanation of the names of the files under the target directory, please refer to the "File_list_explanation.csv" file.
