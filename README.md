**This is a free online repository for sharing GIST/HSA data of COVID19 related protein targets**


For the protien apo sturcture, we currently have GIST/HSA data for 7 different targets (*6JYT*, 6LU7, 6M03, 6W4H, 6W63, 6Y84, 6YB7). For the target 6YB7, we have GIST/HSA data for two different initial stuctures: with M165 flipped (flip) and with M165 in its original conformation (no_flip).

For the protein-ligand complex, we have GIST/HSA data for 2 complexes (6W63_complex and 6Y84_complex).

We ran two MD simulations for each target, with the protein heavy atoms restrained or with the protein side chains left flexible.

For an explanation of the names of the files under the target directory, please refer to the "File_list_explanation.csv" file.


**If requesting GIST/HSA data for other COVID-19 related targets, please contact Dr. Tom Kurtzman at simpleliquid@gmail.com**
